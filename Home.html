    <p class = "About_me"> 
      Ok, so what do i do, well, i do this thing called coding
      ok, but what is coding, well, it is telling a computer what to do.
      and that is coding, there are many programming languages, like python, html, css, javascript, c++, c#, c, etc. the one i am using to make the website is html, css, and javascript</p>
    <p>My favorite programming language is python because you can do data analysis, game development with cocos2d (though nobody uses that at all but RobTop), SEO, and all sorts of other things</p>
      <img src = "Python.jpg" height="150px" ,width="150px" />
     <p>
       And now for my least favorite langauge, and that is Assembly, and here 
       is why
       1. It is impossible to learn
       2. You need to be einstein to even print hello world in it
       3. It is completely useless unless you are making hardware with it
       Oh, and here is a photo to boo at
     </p>
      <img src = "Assembly.jpeg" height="150px" ,width="150px" />"

      Oh, did i forget to mention to show a video about it.
